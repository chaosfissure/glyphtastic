# glyphtastic

This project page is dedicated to Python scripts I create to generate patterns of lines or blocks to look like glyphs, letters, or things of that sort.


# glyphgen.py

Use of this script can be tweaked manually if you want custom effects. 

If you're just looking to generate different numbers of glyphs, force glyphs to behave in various ways during setup, and don't really want to dig into the code, the following command line args are for you:

`vglyphs=number` - the generated image contains glyphs `number` tall. 
`vglyphs=number` - the generated image contains glyphs `number` tall. 
`vglyphs=number` - the generated image contains glyphs `number` tall. 
`vglyphs=number` - the generated image contains glyphs `number` tall.
